# Olist_Capstone_Project
OList is an e-commerce company that is facing some losses recently  and they want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any  unnecessary costs that they might be bearing.

I will be managing the inventory cost of this e-commerce company  called OList.

For this purpose I will identify top products that contribute to the  revenue and also use market basket analysis to analyse the purchase  behavior of individual customers to estimate with relative certainty,  what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in  combination with some other products.
